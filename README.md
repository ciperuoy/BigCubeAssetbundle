# BigCubeAssetbundle
This is my first assetbundle that actually worked! Give it a try if wanted!!

Thank you Chaz (with his tutorial and template), and AnonymousDonut for helping me create this assetbundle.
I can now create better assetbundle, then if wanted, a actual mod with good code.

Please dm "ciperuoy" on discord if there is problem.
